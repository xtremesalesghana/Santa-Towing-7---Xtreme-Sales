            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">1. General Information</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The information provided on this website is intended for general informational purposes only. It may include information about our towing services, service areas, vehicles, pricing, availability, contact information, and related automotive services. While we make reasonable efforts to keep the information accurate and up to date, the information may change at any time without prior notice.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">2. Towing Service Availability</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Displaying a towing service, service area, advert, or contact option on this website does not guarantee that a towing vehicle, driver, equipment, or service will be immediately available. Service availability depends on numerous factors, including but not limited to:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
              <li>Your specific location</li>
              <li>Driver and personnel availability</li>
              <li>The required vehicle type and equipment availability</li>
              <li>Traffic and road conditions</li>
              <li>Severe weather</li>
              <li>The time of the request</li>
              <li>Other operational circumstances</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">3. Response Times</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              While we may promote emergency or 24/7 towing assistance, stating 24/7 availability does not constitute a guaranteed arrival time. Response times naturally vary depending on your location, traffic, weather conditions, local emergencies, road conditions, and driver availability. We do not promise a specific response time unless expressly guaranteed at the time of booking.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">4. Pricing Information</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Prices displayed or communicated through the website are typically estimates and may be subject to change depending on the actual requirements of the towing job. Final charges depend on factors such as distance, vehicle type, vehicle condition, waiting time, special equipment needs, recovery difficulty, and any additional services. Please refer to our <strong>Pricing & Payment Policy</strong> for more detailed information.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">5. Vehicle Information</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Information provided by customers about their vehicles must be accurate. If the actual condition of a vehicle differs from what was initially reported, we or our towing providers may require additional information, specialized equipment, or alternative arrangements after assessing the vehicle in person.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">6. Vehicle Damage and Pre-Existing Conditions</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Vehicles requiring towing frequently have existing mechanical, structural, accident-related, or cosmetic damage prior to our arrival. The contents of this website should not be interpreted as a guarantee that a vehicle will remain completely free from damage during every towing or recovery situation, particularly in difficult recovery scenarios. However, this does not exclude our responsibility for negligence or other responsibilities that cannot be legally excluded.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">7. Third-Party Towing Providers</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Where our website connects you with independent towing drivers or affiliated service providers to execute your request, it is the independent provider who is responsible for carrying out the physical towing operation. We do not claim to directly employ all towing providers or own all towing vehicles operating under our network unless factually accurate for a specific dispatch.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">8. Third-Party Websites and Services</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Our website may contain links or connections to third-party services, including WhatsApp, Google Maps (or other mapping services), payment platforms, social media platforms, and external websites. These third-party services operate independently and are governed by their own terms and privacy policies. Santa Towing assumes no responsibility for their content, accuracy, or functionality.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">9. Emergency Situations</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Our website and services should never be treated as a replacement for official emergency authorities or emergency response services in situations where there is immediate danger to life, health, or public safety. We encourage users to contact the appropriate emergency authorities (such as the police, fire service, or ambulance) when necessary.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">10. Website Accuracy and Availability</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">

            </p>

              <li>All information provided will always be error-free or fully updated.</li>

              <li>Every link or third-party integration will always function without issue.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">11. User-Submitted Information</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Customers are entirely responsible for the accuracy of any information they submit through our website forms, phone calls, WhatsApp messages, towing requests, or other communication channels.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">12. No Unauthorised Guarantees</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Information found on this website should not be interpreted as creating guarantees, warranties, or promises beyond those that are expressly agreed upon in writing between the customer and Santa Towing or the assigned towing provider.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">13. Limitation of Responsibility</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Ghanaian law, Santa Towing shall not be held liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from circumstances outside our reasonable control. This includes delays, service failures, or issues arising from reliance on website information. This limitation does not attempt to remove responsibilities that cannot be legally excluded under Ghanaian law.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">14. Changes to the Disclaimer</h2>
