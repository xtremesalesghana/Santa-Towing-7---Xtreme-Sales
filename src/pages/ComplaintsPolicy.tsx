            <p className="mb-4">
              We encourage you to submit your complaint as soon as reasonably possible after the incident or service. Prompt reporting helps us accurately investigate the matter while information and evidence are still fresh.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">5. Complaint Acknowledgement</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Once we receive your complaint, we will acknowledge it where reasonably possible. During this initial stage, our team may request additional information, documentation, or clarification to properly assess the situation.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">6. Complaint Review Process</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We will make reasonable efforts to assess all complaints fairly and objectively. Our review process may involve:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
              <li>Checking your customer information and service details</li>
              <li>Reviewing relevant communication logs</li>
              <li>Checking payment and billing information</li>

            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">7. Vehicle Damage Complaints</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              If your complaint involves alleged damage to your vehicle during towing, please review our <Link to="/vehicle-damage-liability-policy" className="text-primary font-bold hover:underline">Vehicle Damage & Liability Policy</Link> and provide the following:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">

            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Please note that the submission of a complaint does not automatically establish our responsibility for the damage. We will thoroughly investigate the claim. This process does not attempt to exclude any liability that cannot legally be excluded under Ghanaian law.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">8. Pricing and Payment Complaints</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              If you wish to dispute unexpected charges, incorrect charges, payment issues, refund decisions, or cancellation fees, please detail the discrepancy in your complaint. We encourage you to first review our <Link to="/pricing-payment-policy" className="text-primary font-bold hover:underline">Pricing & Payment Policy</Link> and <Link to="/cancellation-refund-policy" className="text-primary font-bold hover:underline">Cancellation & Refund Policy</Link> to understand how charges are calculated.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">9. Complaints About Towing Providers</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Santa Towing sometimes connects customers with independent towing drivers or affiliated service providers to ensure prompt coverage. If your complaint is regarding the conduct or service of an independent provider, we will review the issue and communicate your concerns directly to the relevant provider. We act as a booking platform for these assignments and do not claim direct ownership of all independent vehicles.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">10. Resolution</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Once our review is complete, we will inform you of the outcome. Possible resolutions may include:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
              <li>A detailed clarification or explanation of the events</li>
              <li>Correction of an administrative error</li>
              <li>A refund (where applicable under our policies)</li>
              <li>Adjustment of an incorrect charge</li>
              <li>Referral of the issue to the relevant independent service provider</li>
              <li>Other reasonable corrective actions</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Please understand that we cannot guarantee a specific, desired outcome for every complaint, but we promise to handle each case fairly.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">11. Escalating a Complaint</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              If you are dissatisfied with our initial response, you may request that your complaint be escalated for further review. An escalated complaint will be reviewed by senior management for a final determination. You also retain any additional consumer rights available to you under applicable Ghanaian law.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">12. False or Abusive Complaints</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We expect customers to provide truthful and accurate information when submitting a complaint. We reserve the right to decline to process or respond to complaints that are clearly fraudulent, threatening, abusive, or submitted repeatedly without providing relevant new information.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">13. Confidentiality and Personal Information</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Information provided during the complaints process will be handled securely and in accordance with our <Link to="/privacy-policy" className="text-primary font-bold hover:underline">Privacy Policy</Link>. However, please note that we cannot guarantee absolute confidentiality if disclosure is required by law or is necessary to properly investigate the complaint (such as discussing the incident with the assigned towing provider).
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">14. Changes to This Policy</h2>
