            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">1. Introduction</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The purpose of this Pricing & Payment Policy is to clearly explain how our towing service prices are determined, when customers may be charged, and how payments are handled. This policy applies to all towing and recovery services requested through our website, phone, WhatsApp, or other official communication channels.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">2. How Towing Prices Are Determined</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Towing prices are not always fixed and may vary depending on the specifics of the required service. Factors that may influence the final price include:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
              <li>Pickup location</li>
              <li>Destination</li>
              <li>Total distance of the tow</li>
              <li>Vehicle type and size</li>
              <li>Vehicle condition (e.g., drivable, non-drivable, missing wheels)</li>
              <li>Time of service (e.g., standard business hours, late-night, or public holidays)</li>
              <li>Waiting time at the pickup or drop-off location</li>
              <li>Road and traffic conditions</li>
              <li>Special towing or recovery equipment required</li>
              <li>Difficult or unusual recovery conditions (e.g., off-road, ditches, severe accidents)</li>
              <li>Additional services requested</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">3. Price Estimates</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Any price estimate provided before our towing provider assesses the situation in person is an estimate based on the information provided. This estimate could change if the actual service requirements differ from the initial details. Where the final price may differ from the initial estimate, we will make reasonable efforts to inform you of significant additional charges before the additional service is carried out.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">4. Additional Charges</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Certain circumstances during the execution of a service may result in additional charges. These circumstances include, but are not limited to:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
              <li>Extra distance required beyond the originally agreed destination</li>
              <li>Extended waiting time caused by the customer or the vehicle not being ready</li>
              <li>The need for special or heavy-duty equipment not initially anticipated</li>
              <li>Difficult vehicle recovery requiring extra labor or time</li>
              <li>Additional towing assistance or secondary vehicles</li>
              <li>Changes to the requested destination after the tow has commenced</li>
              <li>Any other additional services expressly requested by the customer</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">5. Payment Requirements</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Depending on the nature of the service and the established business process, payment may be required before, during, or immediately after the towing service is completed. Our dispatch team or towing providers will clarify the exact payment timing with you when confirming your service request.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">6. Accepted Payment Methods</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We strive to make our payment process as convenient as possible. Currently, we accept the following payment methods:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
              <li>[Editable Placeholder: Mobile Money (MTN MoMo, Telecel Cash, AT Money)]</li>
              <li>[Editable Placeholder: Cash payments directly to the driver]</li>
              <li>[Editable Placeholder: Bank Transfers (must be confirmed before service completion)]</li>

            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">7. Payment Confirmation</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Customers are encouraged to retain their payment confirmations, receipts, mobile money transaction references, or other evidence of payment where applicable, as proof of completed transactions.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">8. Unpaid Services</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              In the event that an agreed towing charge remains unpaid upon completion of the service, Santa Towing reserves the right to withhold the release of the towed vehicle or pursue the outstanding balance through fair and legally appropriate debt recovery channels under Ghanaian law. 
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">9. Cancellations and Payment</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              If a customer cancels a towing request, certain charges may still apply depending on whether a towing provider has already been dispatched or has arrived at the location. For detailed rules regarding cancellations and associated charges, please refer to our <strong>Cancellation & Refund Policy</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">10. Refunds</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Any eligible refunds are handled strictly in accordance with our <strong>Cancellation & Refund Policy</strong>. We do not provide refunds where the towing service has already been substantially provided or where operational costs have already been incurred, unless explicitly required by applicable law or an agreed service arrangement.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">11. Pricing Changes</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Towing prices may change over time due to fluctuations in operating costs, fuel costs, equipment requirements, service areas, or other business factors. However, where a specific price has already been agreed upon for an immediate service, you will not be unexpectedly charged a different amount except where additional services or unforeseen circumstances justify the change, and you are informed where reasonably possible.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">12. Special and Emergency Services</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Emergency, after-hours, difficult recovery, or specialized towing services may be subject to different pricing structures depending on the severity and requirements of the circumstances. Our team will communicate the applicable rates for these specialized services when you request assistance.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">13. Inaccurate Information</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Customers are responsible for providing accurate information regarding their vehicle, location, vehicle condition, and destination. If incorrect information results in the need for additional equipment, extra travel distance, extended waiting time, or other unexpected costs, the customer may be responsible for covering these additional charges.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">14. Disputing a Charge</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
