            <p className="mb-4">
              You agree to use this website only for lawful purposes and in a manner that does not infringe upon the rights of others or restrict their use of the website. You must provide accurate information when making enquiries or booking services. Prohibited uses include using the website for fraudulent, unlawful, abusive, or misleading purposes.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">3. Towing Service Requests</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Submitting a towing request or contacting us does not automatically guarantee immediate service availability. Our ability to provide service may depend on various factors including your location, the condition of your vehicle, the specific towing equipment required, driver availability, traffic conditions, weather, and other unforeseen circumstances.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">4. Customer Responsibilities</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              When requesting towing or roadside assistance, you are responsible for providing accurate and complete information about:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
              <li>Your exact location.</li>
              <li>The type, make, and model of your vehicle.</li>
              <li>The current condition of the vehicle (e.g., whether it rolls, steers, or has missing wheels).</li>
              <li>The intended destination for the tow.</li>
              <li>Accurate contact information so our drivers can reach you.</li>
              <li>Any special towing requirements or potential access issues at the pickup or drop-off location.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">5. Pricing and Payment</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Towing charges are determined based on several factors, which may include the total distance of the tow, the type and size of the vehicle, the location of the pickup and drop-off, the time of day, waiting times at the scene, and whether special equipment is required to safely move the vehicle. Final pricing will be communicated to you prior to the service, and payment must be made as agreed.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">6. Cancellations</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              If you need to cancel a requested service, please notify us immediately. Depending on the time elapsed and whether a dispatch team is already en route or has arrived at your location, a cancellation fee or service charge may apply to cover our dispatched costs.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">7. Vehicle and Personal Belongings</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              It is your responsibility to remove any valuable or personal belongings from the vehicle prior to it being towed, wherever reasonably possible. We cannot be held responsible for the loss or damage of personal items left inside the vehicle during transport.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">8. Vehicle Damage and Liability</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              While we handle all vehicles with professional care, our liability is limited. We are not responsible for pre-existing damage, mechanical problems that occur during transport unrelated to the towing itself, or issues arising from improperly secured vehicles prior to our arrival. Any claims for damage alleged to have occurred during the towing process must be reported to our driver at the time of delivery and submitted in writing.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">9. Third-Party Towing Providers</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              In certain circumstances, or during periods of high demand, we may connect you with independent towing drivers or affiliated service providers to execute your request. In such cases, the independent provider is responsible for the physical execution of the service.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">10. Emergency and 24/7 Services</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We strive to provide emergency and 24/7 towing services; however, actual response times and service availability may vary depending on your location, traffic conditions, severe weather, driver availability, and the specific condition of your vehicle.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">11. Website Content</h2>
