            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">1. About the Towing Service</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">2. Requesting a Towing Service</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              When requesting a towing service, you should provide accurate information to help us dispatch the appropriate vehicle and equipment. This includes:
            </p>

              <li>The vehicle's make, model, and type.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">3. Service Availability</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Submitting a request for towing does not automatically guarantee immediate service. Our ability to respond is subject to availability and may depend on:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
              <li>Your specific location.</li>
              <li>Driver and tow truck availability.</li>
              <li>The specific towing equipment required.</li>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">4. Towing Charges</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Towing charges may vary depending on the specifics of your request. Factors that influence pricing include:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
              <li>The total distance of the tow.</li>
              <li>The vehicle's type and size.</li>
              <li>The pickup and drop-off locations.</li>
              <li>The time of service (e.g., late-night or holiday requests).</li>
              <li>Waiting time upon arrival.</li>
              <li>The need for special equipment.</li>
              <li>Difficult recovery conditions (e.g., vehicles stuck in mud, ditches, or tight spaces).</li>
              <li>Any additional services requested.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">5. Customer Responsibilities</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              To ensure a safe and efficient service, customers must:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
              <li>Provide accurate and complete information during the booking process.</li>
              <li>Provide safe and reasonable access to the vehicle where possible.</li>
              <li>Inform the towing provider of any known vehicle problems or hazards.</li>
              <li>Follow all reasonable instructions from the towing provider regarding safety at the scene.</li>
              <li>Disclose any special circumstances that may affect the towing process.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">6. Vehicle Condition</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              You must accurately describe the vehicle's condition when requesting service, including whether it can start, steer, brake, roll, or move freely. Inaccurate information may result in delays or additional equipment being required, which could affect the final cost or our ability to complete the tow.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">7. Personal Belongings</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We strongly advise all customers to remove valuable and personal belongings from their vehicles before towing whenever reasonably possible. Santa Towing and its providers are not responsible for the loss or damage of unsecured personal belongings left inside the vehicle, except where responsibility is strictly imposed by applicable law.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">8. Vehicle Damage and Pre-Existing Damage</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Vehicles requiring towing often have pre-existing damage or mechanical problems. While we take professional care during the recovery and transport process, we are not responsible for pre-existing damage, mechanical failures unrelated to the tow, or issues arising from the vehicle's existing poor condition. Any concerns regarding handling should be raised with the provider immediately.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">9. Difficult or Unsafe Towing Conditions</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Additional arrangements or specialized equipment may be required for vehicles that are:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
              <li>Severely damaged or structurally compromised.</li>
              <li>Stuck in mud, sand, or water.</li>
              <li>Involved in a major accident.</li>
              <li>Located in difficult terrain or off-road.</li>
              <li>Unable to roll or steer.</li>
              <li>Carrying unusual or heavy loads.</li>
              <li>In an unsafe, restricted, or hazardous location.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The towing provider reserves the right to decline or postpone a job where attempting the tow would create an unreasonable safety risk to personnel, equipment, or the public.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">10. Waiting Time</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Service delays may incur waiting time charges, particularly when the towing provider has arrived at the designated location but the vehicle or customer is not ready for the service to commence.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">11. Cancellation</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              You may cancel a towing request by contacting us immediately. Please note that charges may apply in certain circumstances, such as when a towing provider has already been dispatched or has arrived at your location prior to the cancellation.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">12. Service Delays</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We aim to provide prompt service; however, estimated arrival times are not guaranteed. Response times may be affected by traffic, severe weather, road conditions, ongoing emergencies, vehicle availability, and other circumstances beyond our reasonable control.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">13. Emergency and 24/7 Towing</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Emergency requests and 24/7 towing services are handled with priority, subject to driver, equipment, location, and safety availability. We will communicate the earliest possible arrival time, but we cannot guarantee an immediate response under all operational conditions.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">14. Towing Provider Relationship</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Santa Towing may connect you with independent towing drivers or affiliated towing providers to fulfill your service request. In such instances, the independent provider is directly responsible for the execution of the tow and adherence to safety standards.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">15. Payment</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Customers are responsible for paying all applicable towing charges according to the agreed pricing terms prior to or upon completion of the service.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">16. Prohibited or Unsafe Requests</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The towing provider reserves the right to refuse requests involving unlawful activities, unsafe conditions, hazardous situations, or circumstances where the requested service cannot reasonably be performed safely or legally.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">17. Complaints and Disputes</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">

            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-dark/10 pb-2">18. Changes to These Towing Service Terms</h2>
